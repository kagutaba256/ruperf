## Overview

See the [overview](https://HOMS-OSS.github.io/ruperf/docs/overview) for an introduction to the project.

## Requirements

Rust is required for this project. To download Rustup and install Rust:

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

[More on installing Rust][3].

Linux 5.x+ is required to run this project.

## Build

To build this project:

- Checkout `main` branch from github using `git clone`.
- From top-level directory run `cargo build`. 
  - For best profiling specify `cargo build --release` as cargo will default to `debug`.

To build a sample program:
- ```bash
cargo build -p file-io
```

- ```bash
cargo build -p fp-calc
```

## Install

To install this project:

- With the project repository downloaded, run `cargo install --path *ruperf_path*` where `*ruperf_path*` is the path to the ruperf repository on your machine.
- For configuration information about `cargo install` including information about how to specify installation location, etc see [documentation][8]
- Another option is to build the code using `cargo build` and then `cd` into the `target` directory and select the target.

## Run

- See ```./ruperf --help```

- Examples:
  - ```bash
  ./ruperf stat -e cycles -e instructions -e task-clock -e L1D-cache-reads ls -a
  ```
  - ```bash
  ./ruperf test --json
  ```
  - ``` bash
  ./ruperf gui
  ```
- See our rustdocs for more documentation by running ```cargo doc --no-deps --open``` in the ruperf repository.

## Verification

Verification is done through a combination of `cargo test`, manual inspection comparing output of `perf stat` with output of `ruperf` on programs as documented in pull request history, and through inspection of contributor code.

## Demo/Walkthrough



## Permissions

This tool uses the `perf_event_open()` system call, which requires some special permissions. 
While our tool currently checks if `perf_event_paranoid` is equal to 0,
this is less than ideal is some situations. A way around this is to change
the capabilities of the `ruperf` executable using [`setcap`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setcap.8.html). 

For Linux 5.8+, use `CAP_PERFMON`; otherwise use `CAP_SYSADMIN`.

## Contributing Guidelines

`ruperf` is an open source project and is open to recieving contributions!
